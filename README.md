## About This Portfolio

This repository documents my **learning journey** through the _NCFE Level 3 Certificate in Cyber Security Practices (603/5762/9)_.  
It is based on my **portfolio of evidence**, showing both theoretical understanding and practical lab activities.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a **unit** from the qualification and contains:

- Written reports and case studies (in `.pdf` or `.md`)
- Lab simulations and vulnerability assessment results (sanitised)
- Reflections and learning logs

This repository is designed to demonstrate both **academic progression** and **employability skills** for entry-level roles in cybersecurity support, SOC analysis, or IT security administration.

## Learning Goals

By completing this qualification and building this portfolio, I aim to:

- Understand the **core principles** of cyber security and its business impact.
- Develop **threat intelligence** and OSINT awareness skills.
- Gain hands-on experience with **vulnerability testing**, **endpoint protection**, and **incident mitigation**.
- Demonstrate ethical behaviour, evidence-based reporting, and secure documentation.

## Unit Overview (This Repository Covers 6 Units)

### **Unit 01 - Understand Cyber Security Principles**

> Business impact & case studies (TFL simulation, Demise of KNP)

**What I Learned**

- The importance of the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
- How cyber attacks disrupt **business operations** and **supply chains**.
- How to perform a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**.
- The concept of **defence in depth** and layered controls.
- The importance of **governance, backups, and recovery plans**.

**Case study**

- **TFL transport resilience** scenario, identifying network segmentation weaknesses.
- **Demise of KNP** case, how lack of governance led to business failure.

### **Unit 02 - Threat Intelligence in Cyber Security**

> Threat briefs and OSINT research (ABC Zipper case study)

**What I Learned**

- How to collect and evaluate **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** safely and ethically.
- The difference between **indicators of compromise (IoCs)**, **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)**.
- How to create **threat profiles** and **threat briefs** for businesses.
- The importance of **source validation** and **data sanitisation** in threat research.

**Case study**

- **Threat Brief for ABC Zipper**, a fictional retail company targeted by POS malware.
- Conducted **sanitised OSINT research** using public advisories (no scanning).
- Created a **threat actor profile** (financially motivated retail attacker).

### **Unit 03 - Testing Vulnerabilities & Controls**

> Lab vulnerability assessments and endpoint/USB security exercise

**What I Learned**

- The fundamentals of **ethical testing** and **lab-based vulnerability assessment**.
- How to identify, categorise, and prioritise **vulnerabilities** using risk scoring.
- How to report findings clearly and recommend **remediations**.
- The role of **endpoint protection**, **device control**, and **event logging**.

**What I Did**

- **USB endpoint protection simulation** in Windows (using Event Viewer logs).
- Recommended mitigations for removable-media controls and policy enforcement.
